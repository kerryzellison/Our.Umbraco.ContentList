# Our Umbraco Content List

## Overview

A responsive content list component for the Umbraco grid.
Features templatable views and extensible data sources.

## Status

This is being extracted from the starter site we use at [MarkedsPartner](http://www.markedspartner.no).
We only use typed models and the content list currently just do `IListableContent` implementations.

I'm working on regular `IPublishedContent` data sources and configurable mode so it can be used in any site.

To be tweeted and blogged about when a beta is ready.

Meanwhile, here's a teaser. :)
